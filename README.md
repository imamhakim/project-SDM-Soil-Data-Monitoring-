# project-SDM-Soil-Data-Monitoring-
this is my project to create an app for monitoring data from the device i created before. my device can use to take data (soil pH, soil moisture, humidity) and send them to my laptop with IoT, then my app will process the data so we can know what kind of plant that suitable for the soil 

this app use python 2.7 as language program with some modules:
1. Tkinter
2. serial
3. xlsxwriter
4. Time
5. matplotlib

*SDM_APP.py it's a main sketch of the app

*setup.py it uses to convert py to exe with cx_freeze (you also can see a lot of tutorials in youtube). my python sketch it still need's more development so it can be more userfriendly.

*xbee.ino it's a sketch for microcontroller inside the device, i use an arduino uno microcontroller

i hope this can help you
